The program postproc.py takes as an argument the path of a directory. It reads in and processes all files
of extension .CSV within that directory. The result is an OpenOffice Calc file (extension .ODS) with the
processed results.

It requires Python 2.7.

To allow a right-click context menu in Ubuntu with Thunar as the file browser, edit the file ~/.config/Thunar/uca.xml
in the following way:


<actions>

    :
    :
   (Existing content is here)
    :
    :
<action>
	<icon>ooo-calc</icon>
	<name>Process Vib</name>
	<unique-id>1477740595582654-2</unique-id>
	<command>python ~/Arduino/Sketches/Working/vibration-record/Post-process/postproc.py %f</command>
	<description>Send to vibration analysis python program</description>
	<patterns>*</patterns>
	<directories/>
</action>
<action>
	<icon>ooo-calc</icon>
	<name>Process Vib</name>
	<unique-id>1477740595582654-2</unique-id>
	<command>python ~/Arduino/Sketches/Working/vibration-record/Post-process/postproc.py %F</command>
	<description>Send to vibration analysis python program</description>
	<patterns>*.CSV</patterns>
	<text-files/>
	<other-files/>
</action>
</actions>


The result of this change is to allow a right-click context menu on either of the following selections:
  *  A single directory (presumably with multiple .CSV files inside it), or
  *  Multiple .CSV files within the same directory
